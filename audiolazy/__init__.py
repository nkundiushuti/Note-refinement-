AudioLazy package

This is the main package file, that already imports all modules into the
system. As the full name might not be small enough for typing it everywhere,
you can import with a helpful alias:

  >>> import audiolazy as lz
  >>> lz.Stream(1, 3, 2).take(8)
  [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3]

But there's some parts of the code you probably will find it cleaner to import
directly, like the ``z`` object:

  >>> from audiolazy import z, Stream
  >>> filt = 1 / (1 - z ** -1) # Accumulator linear filter
  >>> filt(Stream(1, 3, 2), zero=0).take(8)
  [1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16]

For a single use within a console or for trying some new experimental ideas
(perhaps with IPython), you would perhaps find easier to import the full
package contents:

  >>> from audiolazy import *
  >>> s, Hz = sHz(44100)
  >>> delay_a4 = freq_to_lag(440 * Hz)
  >>> filt = ParallelFilter(comb.tau(delay_a4, 20 * s),
  ...                       resonator(440 * Hz, bandwidth=100 * Hz)
  ...                      )
  >>> len(filt)
  2

There's documentation inside the package classes and functions docstrings.
If you try ``dir(audiolazy)`` [or ``dir(lz)``] after importing it [with the
suggested alias], you'll see all the package contents, and the names starting
with ``lazy`` followed by an underscore are modules. If you're starting now,
try to see the docstring from the Stream and ZFilter classes with the
``help(lz.Stream)`` and ``help(lz.ZFilter)`` commands, and then the help from
the other functionalities used above. If you didn't know the ``dir`` and
``help`` built-ins before reading this, it's strongly suggested you to read
first a Python documentation or tutorial, at least enough for you to
understand the basic behaviour and syntax of ``for`` loops, iterators,
iterables, lists, generators, list comprehensions and decorators.
