  """
  Constants for using the real bandwidth in the gammatone filter, given its

  Based on equations from:

    GammaTone Filter Bank. In: SVOS Final Report, Annex C, Part A: The
    Auditory Filter Bank. 1988.``

  First returned value is a bandwidth compensation for direct use in the
  gammatone formula:

  >>> round(x, 3)

  >>> bandwidth = x * erb["moore_glasberg_83"](central_frequency)

  Second returned value helps us find the ``3 dB`` bandwidth as:

  >>> x, y = gammatone_erb_constants(4)
  >>> central_frequency = 1000
  >>> bandwidth3dB = x * y * erb["moore_glasberg_83"](central_frequency)
